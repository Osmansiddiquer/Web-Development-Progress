    One should be aware of these basic things.
    <p>
        What if you need to write out the tag for paragraph? You need to use entities.
        &lt;p&gt; (look at source)
        Entitites can be used to write reserved words/characters, and those characters that are not on the keyboard
        <br>
        &pound;
        <br>
        <!-- You can directly write unicode for the symbols too -->
        &#xFDFA; 
        <br>
