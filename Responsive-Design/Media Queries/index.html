            Media Queries in RWD allow the designer to apply CSS selectively depending upon different media configurations (such as screen size).
        </p>
        <h2><u>Usage</u>:</h2>
        <p class="text-indent">
            A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g. mobile phones), then check for wider screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. Designing for mobile first is known as mobile first design.
        </p>
        <p class = "text-indent">
            You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as breakpoints. <em>If using breakpoints, best practices encourage defining media query breakpoints with relative units like rem rather than absolute sizes of an individual device.</em>
